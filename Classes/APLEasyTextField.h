 * UITextField has by default no left or right margin for the text rect. 
 * No app ever whants to use that default. Changing the text rect and 
 * other things like the placeholder rect etc. requires overriding UITextField. 
 * This sucks hence this simpel class provides properties to manipulate certain 
 * things you could otherwise only change by overriding UITextField.
